# maxjacobson's dotfiles

These are config files and scripts I like to have on my computers.

I use [rcm] to manage these files.

You can run the `check_expected_bins` script to see if programs are installed that are managed outside of this set of scripts.

## usage

* install [rcm]
* `git clone https://github.com/maxjacobson/dotfiles.git  ~/.dotfiles`
* run `rcup -v`

[rcm]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm
