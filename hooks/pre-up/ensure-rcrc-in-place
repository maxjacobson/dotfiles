# Without this, on the first run, it is not yet in place, and so I get a `~/.README.md` and a `~/.bin`.
# This bootstrapping problem is discussed at length here: https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm/issues/103

# After this hook runs, rcup will actually overwrite the ~/.rcrc with a symlink to ~/.dotfiles/rcrc, which is fine, whatever.
