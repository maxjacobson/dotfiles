# my dotfiles

Most of these are actually dotfiles (meaning, files whose filename begins with
a dot and belong in your home directory). The files in the "bin" folder are
helpful scripts that some of the dotfiles might depend on.

Put them on your $PATH if you want to use them.

Also, copy the .zsh-customizations folder into your home folder.
