" settings just for GUI vim, specifically Macvim
" (get the latest release from here: https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/releases)
set guifont=Monaco:h17
" download smyck colorscheme from here: http://color.smyck.org/
" copy smyck.vim to ~/.vim/colors to install
" it's pretty nice
" the colorscheme should only be used for gvim/macvim,
" for terminal vim, the colorscheme should be installed on the terminal level,
" not on the vim level
colorscheme smyck
